/*
 * The size of the circular buffer for recording.
 * This size should be sufficient to hold enough audio data
 * as is necessary in between calls to MMAPI_ReadBuffer()
 * from method EAS.nreadRecordedBytes().
 * The absolute minimum is the amount of input wave data
 * that is necessary for filling one render buffer.
 * E.g. rendering is in 128 samples buffers, at 11025Hz
 * mono. Now an input file be in CD quality, it requires
 * 4 times more data for the higher sampling rate, and
 * twice as much data for 2 channels to fill 128 samples.
 * Now with a faster playback rate of maximum 200%, the
 * recording circular buffer needs to be at least
 * 4*2*2*128 = 2048 samples -> 4096 bytes (to allow 16-bit
 * samples).
 * The current design reads the recorded data asynchronous
 * to the rendering thread, so even more data should be
 * reserved for the recording circular buffer to prevent
 * buffer overflows.
